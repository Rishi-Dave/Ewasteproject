   <hr>
   <p>ERS is an organization that collects electronic waste through a organized process and 
       delivers it to e-waste facilities. Through this process, we can efficiently recycle electronic waste
       which would go to a dump instead and pollute our atmosphere. The world has limited resources and it is important for everyone to play a part.
       By participating in our goal, you can also make a positive impact on our world.
